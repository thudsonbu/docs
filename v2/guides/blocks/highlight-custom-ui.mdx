:::tip Custom UI
If you plan on using your own **custom components** for the UI you will have to use the `supertokens-web-js` library and manually call the authentication routes. 
Use this demo app for a guideline on how everything on the backend should work and check our <GuideRecipeLink link="custom-ui/init/frontend">page</GuideRecipeLink> that shows how authentication methods should look like on the frontend.
