import BackendConfigFile from './backend-config-file.mdx' 

This folder includes a sample server that exposes the authentication routes.


There are two files included in this project. 

##### `config.ts`

<BackendConfigFile />

##### `index.ts`

This file initializes a simple Express server that makes use of two functions to expose the auth functionalities:
- `middleware`: This adds the authentication routes to the Express App 
- `errorHandler`: This manages the errors that can be thrown in the authentication flows and includes standardized responses

There are also examples on how to configure CORS, and how to use our session verification middleware to protect your endpoints. The endpoints in this file are just example ones and don't need to be added to your backend.
:::important
The order in which each function is called matters. You need to add the CORS config first, then the **SuperTokens** middleware and after that the rest of the
routes that you have in your project.
