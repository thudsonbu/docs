import { GuideRecipeLink } from "/src/components/guides/GuideRecipeLink"

As the name suggests, this file configures the SuperTokens SDK and the features that your instance will use.
In it, you will find examples for the following setup steps:

1. Connecting to the **SuperTokens Core Service**. The value is set to `https://try.supertokens.com`. This is a demo server we host so you can get started quickly. Later on in the guide, we will spin up a dedicated managed or self hosted core service, and, based on that, we will updated the URL. 
2. Specifying details about your application. The information configured works for the demo app, but you will likely want to change it based on your setup. You can learn more about this config <GuideRecipeLink link="appinfo">here</GuideRecipeLink>.
3. Selecting and initialising the authentication **recipes** that you need. Think of recipes as modules or features you enable. The list of recipes that are enabled here will affect which APIs are exposed via the **Backend SDK** middleware. Based on your use case, you may have to modify the parameters values provided to the recipes. We will go into detail about each recipe in the next sections.
