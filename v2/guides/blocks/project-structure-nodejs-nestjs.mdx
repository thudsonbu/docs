##### `/auth`

This section can be copy and pasted directly into your existing project without any additional changes. 
In here you will find abstractions for initializing the **SDK**, communicating with the [**SuperTokens Core Service**](/core-service) and common **NestJS** utilities like `guards`, `filters`, `decorators` and `middlewares`.

The middleware file, `auth.middleware.ts`, will include the authentication routes that will enable the login flows to your users.

##### `config.ts`

<BackendConfigFile />

##### `app.controller.ts`

Check this file for examples on how to use the guards and decorators exposed by the `/auth` folder. This way you can protect your endpoints and access session specific data.

##### `app.module.ts`

Provides an example of how to import the authentication functionality in your main **NestJS** module.

##### `module.ts`

Includes a `bootstrap` call that configures CORS and sets up an exception filter that will catch any authentication related errors and return proper responses.
